# Ticketing-Client-Android
Android Chatbot application (looks pretty much like Google Assistant App) which interacts with user using natural language /voice interaction by leveraging Google’s api.ai NLP platform to auto populate request attributes and then asks users to provide missing details using speech /chat interaction and finally creates ticket into [Diamantedesk](https://diamantedesk.com/getting-started/) system. It also supports fetching past ticket details.
